## Status

Completed. Key feedback given during the process:
1. iOS, Mac, Android need separate tickets — each platform has different icon contexts
2. This is a rebrand, not just an icon swap
3. Must audit all surfaces: logo vs. app icon replacements

## Outcome

Ticket closed. Rebrand assets delivered.
