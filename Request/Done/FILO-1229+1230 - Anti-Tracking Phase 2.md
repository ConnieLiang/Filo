## Status

Design phase completed. This ticket is in the Done folder because the design work is finished — it's now in engineering's hands.

## Alignment with Filo Principles

Strong alignment with **"Respect attention"** — email tracking pixels and read receipts create invisible surveillance pressure. Users feel anxious knowing senders can see when they've opened an email. Anti-tracking removes this pressure, letting users read and respond on their own terms.

Particularly relevant for Filo's target users (immigrants, foreign merchandisers) who may receive tracked emails from unfamiliar institutions and feel compelled to respond immediately.
