# Request Pipeline

Incoming feature/design requests triaged by AI against Filo's product principles.

## Folder Structure

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Todo** | Validated requests with enough detail to start design work |
| **Doing** | Actively being designed or reviewed |
| **Done** | Completed — design delivered or request closed |

## Triage Criteria

A request **passes** if it:
- Reduces cognitive friction for Filo's target users (immigrants, students, financial advisors, small business owners, foreign merchandisers, knowledge workers)
- Aligns with Filo's principles: calm UI, AI as infrastructure, opinionated defaults, respect for attention
- Solves a real problem for people who live in their inbox and are interrupted constantly

A request **gets pushed back** if it:
- Adds options/decisions/visual weight without clear justification
- Is a "feature checklist" item with no user pain behind it
- Targets users outside Filo's audience
- Creates dopamine-driven, attention-grabbing, or dark-pattern UI
- Turns Filo into "another inbox skin" or a "do everything productivity hub"

## Document Format

Each approved request becomes a markdown file named:
`[TICKET-KEY] - Short Title.md`

Contains: context, user problem, proposed solution direction, open questions, and design constraints.
