# Filo Project Rules

## Important References

**Always consult these files before implementing features or drawing UI:**
- `About Filo.md` — Product vision, principles, and feature definitions
- `Design Guidelines/` — Visual design system (colors, typography, icons, components)

## Project Description

Filo is an AI-native email client designed to reduce cognitive load. It helps people understand, act on, and move past email without wasting attention.

**Core belief:** Email overload is not a volume problem. It's a decision fatigue problem.

## Product Principles (from About Filo.md)

1. **Reduce cognitive friction** — Every feature must reduce thinking, not shift it elsewhere
2. **AI as infrastructure, not spectacle** — AI runs quietly in the background, no forced prompts
3. **Opinionated defaults** — Filo makes decisions so users don't have to
4. **Respect attention** — No dopamine-driven UI, no fake urgency, no dark patterns

**Internal reminder:** If a feature adds options, decisions, visual weight, or explanation — it needs to justify itself. **Less is the feature.**

## Architecture

### Platforms
- iOS: Swift/SwiftUI
- macOS: Swift/SwiftUI
- Android: TBD
- Windows: TBD

### Key Directories
- `Shared/` - Cross-platform Swift code (models, view models)
- `iOS/` - iOS-specific implementations
- `macOS/` - macOS-specific implementations
- `Android/` - Android-specific code
- `Windows/` - Windows-specific code
- `Resources/` - Asset catalogs, shared resources
- `Design Guidelines/` - Visual design system (synced from Figma)

## Coding Conventions

### Swift (iOS/macOS)
- Use SwiftUI for all new views
- Follow MVVM pattern
- Use `@Observable` macro for view models (iOS 17+/macOS 14+)
- Prefer async/await over completion handlers

### Naming
- Views: `*View.swift` (e.g., `HomeView.swift`)
- View Models: `*ViewModel.swift`
- Models: Plain name (e.g., `User.swift`, `Item.swift`)

## UI/UX Guidelines

When drawing UI:
- Keep interfaces calm and minimal
- Prioritize clarity over customization
- Use the design system from `Design Guidelines/` (colors, typography, icons)
- No visual clutter or unnecessary elements
- Design for scanning, not reading

## Things to Avoid
- Don't use UIKit/AppKit unless absolutely necessary
- Don't hardcode strings (use localization)
- Don't commit API keys or secrets
- Don't add features that increase cognitive load
- Don't create dopamine-driven or attention-grabbing UI patterns

## Current Focus
- iOS MVP
- macOS MVP
